For this week's assignment, I created a small choosing game. If you click yes, you can see four cute puppy pictures. If you click no, it will keep asking you the same question. In the end, a new window will pop up. And when you close the pop up, there is only one option left for you.

In this small website, I used Javascript to create functions for the buttons. The buttons will control the display of other buttons; changing images; changing the text in the "<p>"; showing pop up windows, etc.
  
I used css to change the style of the buttons and the image. I also practiced using display: flex. It was very useful after I understand how it works.
